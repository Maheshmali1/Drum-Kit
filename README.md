# Drum-Kit

"Introducing the Drum Kit project - an interactive drum set made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

This project allows users to play different drum sounds by clicking on the corresponding drum pad. The user interface is designed using HTML and CSS, while the functionality is implemented using JavaScript. 

Each drum pad is linked to a specific sound, and the JavaScript code allows the user to play the sound when the pad is clicked. 

The project also includes a visual animation when the pad is clicked to give a more realistic drumming experience. The code and instructions for the project can be found in this Github repository,

Give it a try and unleash your inner drummer!"
